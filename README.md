# Menu list App

The **https://parceljs.org/** used for module packaging.

**https://sass-lang.com/** was used as css preprocessor.

Eslint is developed using **https://standardjs.com/**.

An application was developed using "/src/data/restaurant.json" and "/src/data/menu.json" to list menu with ReactJs.

In a single page application, we can add and remove menus to the basket. While adding, we can determine the number we want to add from the input next to the menus. We can remove the lists we add in the shopping cart. We dynamically calculate the total cost of the products in the shopping cart.
